# What's this?

This is a MATLAB-based GUI that plots and filters your ECG data from noise with the power of Fourrier transforms. 
Noise is an inevitable part of any data, but Fourrier transforms allow us to get rid of constant-frequency noise signals. In the particular case of ECG data, for example, one may want to remove frequencies that are significantly faster than than those normally observed in the human heartbeat, as they may be caused by artificial AC signals from the equipment used.

# How to use?

You will need to have MATLAB installed in your computer before being able to execute the program. But aside from that, it's simple! Open up
